        "\n",
        "ans->Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes readability and simplicity in its syntax. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is an open-source language, and it is known for being highly readable and easy to learn, making it popular for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",

        "\n",
        "a.Easy to Learn and Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's syntax is simple and intuitive, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners. The language's structure emphasizes readability, and its use of indentation rather than braces or keywords to define code blocks makes it easy to write and understand\n",
        "\n",
        "b.Versatility and Flexibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), scientific computing, automation, and more. It also has a strong ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities.\n",

        "# **2.What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "ans-> the intepreter in a python is program tha reads and executes the code line by line, converting it to machine readable instruction for the computer. Key Points about the Python Interpreter: Line-by-Line Execution: The interpreter executes code one line at a time, making it easier to debug since errors are caught immediately upon execution. Dynamic Nature: Python doesn't require a compilation step. The interpreter handles code execution directly, which speeds up the development process. Interactive Environment: Python interpreters provide an interactive mode (accessed by typing python or python3 in the terminal), where developers can write and execute Python commands in real-time. Portability: The Python interpreter works across platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), enabling Python code to run on different systems without modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "ans-> In Python, pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names) because they are integral to Python's syntax and functionality. Characteristics of Python Keywords: Predefined: Their meaning is fixed in the Python interpreter. Case-Sensitive: All keywords must be written in lowercase (except for True, False, and None which start with an uppercase letter).\n",
        "\n",
        "# **4.Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "ans->No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that are part of the Python syntax, and their meaning is predefined by the language. Using them as variable names would cause a syntax error, as it would conflict with their intended purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **5.What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "ans->Mutability in Python refers to an object's ability to be changed (or modified) after it has been created. Based on this characteristic, Python objects are classified into two categories: mutable and immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Mutable Objects These objects can be modified after creation. You can change their content, add or remove elements, or modify existing ones without changing the object's identity (its memory address remains the same).\n",

        "ans->Lists: Mutable by Design Purpose: Lists are designed for flexibility and dynamic operations, where elements may need to be added, removed, or modified frequently. Implementation: Python allows modifications to the elements of a list in-place without creating a new object. This is achieved by allocating extra memory for lists, enabling dynamic resizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "->Tuples: Immutable by Design Purpose: Tuples are designed for fixed, unchangeable data structures. They are often used for data that should not be modified after creation, ensuring data integrity. Implementation: Tuples store their elements in a fixed memory structure, which avoids the overhead of dynamic resizing. This makes tuples more memory-efficient and faster to access than lists.\n",
